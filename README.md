# AI-Powered SQL Chatbot for Odoo PostgreSQL Database

This project is an AI-powered SQL Query Chatbot built using Streamlit and Vanna AI, designed to generate and execute SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database containing Odoo-based data. The chatbot transforms natural language input into SQL queries, making it easy to retrieve and visualize data from complex relational tables.

---

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses Vanna AI to interpret user queries and convert them into SQL.
- **Dynamic SQL Generation**: Automatically generates SQL queries based on user input.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch data from Odoo tables.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual representations of query results using Plotly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a conversational and interactive experience.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Libraries: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `vanna`, `psycopg2`, `plotly`

---

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myvenv
   source myvenv/bin/activate   # On Linux or macOS
   myvenv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up API Key and Database Configuration**:
   - Create a `.streamlit` folder in the root directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir .streamlit
     ```
   - Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`:
     ```bash
     touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
     ```
   - Open `secrets.toml` and add the following content:
     ```toml
     [vanna]
     api_key = "YOUR_VANNA_API_KEY"
     ```
   - **Note**: Replace `"YOUR_VANNA_API_KEY"` with your actual Vanna API key.

---

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **Interact with the Chatbot**:
   - Enter natural language queries to fetch data from the database.
   - View query results and visualizations directly in the web interface.

---

## Configuration Details
- **Database Connection**: The database connection parameters (server host, port, database name, username, and password) are hardcoded in the `conn_params()` function. Update these details as needed for your setup.
- **Vanna AI Model**: The model name used is `'chinook'`. You can modify this based on your requirements.

## Potential Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Add custom error handling for more informative feedback on query issues.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement query optimizations for large datasets.
- **User Guidance**: Include tooltips or instructions to help users with query phrasing.
